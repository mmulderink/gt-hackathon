I am in a hackathon. I want to complete the code part quick

Our idea: Do KGNN graph based retrieval instead of embedding. Furthermore, create an enterprise style software ready for RAG based retrieval of data. Create the best use case (ex. Looking through product orders) and find a super easy to integrate software into it. Also incorporate evaluation into the process and then visualization and the key is too when a prompt is made going through the nodes by telling the user what is being visited. User feedback should be stored and then in a fine-tuning process should occur so that right and wrong answers can be updated. Add a user view (chatbot essentially) to the enterprise page so we can show off the features. Store the results in Neon database. Basically go on to add more features that will give us a better chance of winning the competition, focusing on the specifics of the prompt and especially the goal. Part of my thinking is that graphs are easy to incorporate, but can appear much trickier like we did a lot more when discussing, so it can be a competitive edge, especially with the explainability that it would allow for.


Prompt (follow up on paragraph above): I like the medical device support idea as our test data because as mentioned, the project works well with the high stakes data company's work with. Also note that I don't really want to say that the idea is simple (thats just a note to you), i want it to look sophicated to the judges. Use tailwind style to make it look modern yet enterpise ready. I want a visuals tab, that shows the process of a prompt going through the process for the item that has just been run in the user demo tab. in the user demo tab, make the nodes traversed a visual experience. add a tab for evaluation and updates based on the thumbs up / thumbs down given in the users tab. also make a tab for importing the data, as one selling point is our tech can automatically make a company's structured tables into graphs for them. make a visual where after the data is imported, a user's 2nd step is to then define the rules themselves in a nice, graphical way. Also make a tab for old chats. 

write the entire code i'd need in react.


Here is the challenge prompt that we are doing: As Al systems move from experimental demos to mission-critical enterprise workflows, reliability has become the defining challenge. In this track, participants will explore how to design, build, and evaluate **Al systems that organizations can actually trust**: models and agents that are robust, explainable, compliant, and production-ready.

Teams are invited to tackle problems that make Al work in the real world: monitoring model drift, building guardrails for LLMs, detecting hallucinations, ensuring data privacy, enforcing safety policies, or improving auditability and human-in-the-loop feedback. Projects might range from reliability infrastructure (evaluation frameworks, red-team tools, observability dashboards) to applied systems (Al copilots with verifiable reasoning, domain-specific trust layers, or compliance-aware workflows).

The goal: **make Al enterprise-grade**—reliable, repeatable, and responsible.

**Who should join:** builders who care as much about trust as performance—ML engineers, data scientists, reliability researchers, and enterprise developers eager to push AI from prototype to production.
